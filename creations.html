                    <p>"Lady at the diner" is inspired by Alice Neel's portraits. I first encountered Alice Neel at Sara
                        Kay
                        Gallery, New York, in 2019. Her portraits, or "Pictures of People" as she preferred, was up next
                        to
                        Picasso's work. I was immediately drawn to the way she painted Lida Moser, her photojournalist
                        friend.
                        Neel's paintings captured the individuality of her subject but also reflected her perception of
                        them.<br />
                        Alice Neel (1900 - 1984), an American artist, is famously known for her portraits of her
                        friends, family and
                        other contemporary artists of her time. She had a unique style of using color to express the
                        subject’s
                        emotions. She never wavered from her painting style, which was marked by social realism, and
                        never hesitated
                        to show people when they're at their most vulnerable - claiming herself to be a "Collector of
                        Souls". Her
                        other paintings included still life and cityscapes.

                    <h2 class="sub-headings">The Masked Man</h2>
                    <p>The Masked Man" is inspired by Margaret Keane paintings. I was drawn to Keane's paintings because
                        of the
                        subjects' eyes. Back when I had just started drawing regularly, I would skip drawing eyes -
                        worried that I
                        would mess it up.<br />
                        Margaret Keane McGuire, an American artist, is known for her big-eyed paintings. She started
                        painting at a
                        young age. One striking feature of all her paintings is the "big-eyed" subject.<br />
                        After moving to San Francisco, she met a real estate agent named Walter Keane who she married
                        shortly after.
                        Margaret's paintings were available in art exhibitions. Post marriage, Walter, with his charm,
                        took care of
                        marketing and sales. Soon, Keane's paintings, prints, postcards and posters were seen almost in
                        every
                        household. These paintings were signed "Keane". But who was the real Keane painting these?<br />
                        Margaret didn't realise at first that her husband was taking credit for all her paintings. She
                        was expected
                        to paint throughout the day while Walter sold these and earned big sums of money.
                        "I was always drawing eyes, even as a child. Eyes fascinated me."<br />
                        Her big-eyed paintings soon reflected the sadness and anguish she was suffering in her second
                        marriage.
                        Being unable to call her paintings as her own, tormented her. Soon after their divorce, Margaret
                        sued her
                        husband and claimed that the paintings were hers. After a long legal battle and "paint off"
                        challenging
                        Walter, both the Keane's were asked to paint in front of the jury. She won the case.<br />
                        "Big Eyes" (2014) starring Amy Adams & Christoph Waltz is based on Margaret's life.

                    <p>"Don't judge a book by its cover" but it was Ella Fitzgerald's album cover with
                        Bernard Buffet's artwork that caught my attention.<br />
                        Bernard Buffet (1928-1999) is a French expressionist painter. His works largely included
                        portraits,
                        still-lifes and lithographs. While abstract art was gaining popularity, Buffet continued to
                        vouch for
                        representational art. His work prominently expressed the postwar period. His painting style with
                        "spiky,
                        angular and elongated forms" is easily distinguishable from his contemporaries.</p>

                    <p>
                        Remember when Ed Sheeran released “Afterglow” last December? The album art was painted by the
                        singer himself in the “pollockesque” style.</br>
                        Paul Jackson Pollock, (1912 - 1956), was one of the pioneers of the Abstract Expressionism
                        movement. He is mostly known for his “action painting” style, a term defined by the American art
                        critic Harold Rosenberg.</br>
                        Otherwise known as gestural painting, action painting is more about the painting process itself
                        than the finished product. Pollock used to pour and splash paint across his canvases which were
                        stretched out on the floor. He tore apart the restrictions of lines and shapes and painted with
                        loud gestures, covering every inch of the canvas. Pollock’s success and popularity cannot be
                        fully understood without talking about the art critic, Clement Greenberg, whose articles
                        highlighted Pollock’s works and his “drip” technique.</br>
                        “My method of painting is a natural growth out of a need. I want to express my feelings rather
                        than illustrate them.”</br>
                        Abstract paintings are often difficult to completely understand and it is tougher still to
                        interpret the artist’s intention. Yet, standing in front of a Pollock engulfs you entirely,
                        similar to a mural, and it moves you.</br>
                        Also, action painting is relaxing! So blast your favourite music and splash paint over a canvas.
                        But make sure to cover the floor, unless you want to recreate Pollock’s art studio floor!</br>

                    <p>I read about Maud Lewis for the first time when I came across a news article about the sale of
                        fake artworks. Maud Kathleen Lewis (1903 - 1970), a Canadian folk artist, is known for her
                        bright and colourful works. What may appear to be simple, but yet a bold use of paints, Maud's
                        artworks can transport to you a different "world of no shadows".
                        Her life in her small house and its surrounding regions is reflected in her bright paintings.
                        What began as painting Christmas cards along with her mother at a young age, Maud went on to
                        paint almost every object in her house and sell paintings in her community.
                        Despite her rheumatoid arthritis and inability to buy expensive art supplies, Maud used a mix of
                        available and donated paints to portray daily incidents and country views in her own distinct
                        style. Her house and artworks are a burst of joyful colors.

                    <p>
                        "Before the Rush Hour" is inspired by the Katz painting style.
                        It hints at the time right before the office crowd enter the trains, barely leaving any place to
                        even stand. The ladies here are comfortably sitting before being asked to scooch over.
                        It also portrays the moments of quietness where a woman can ruminate on her day before she
                        reaches her house and gets started on her chores. I've often noticed that the ladies compartment
                        is quieter in the evenings (unless a fight breaks out). By quieter, I mean, you would see women
                        catching up with their friends on calls or reading or even finishing off the smaller chores.
                        Over the past year, I wonder how many women got these moments of quietness for themselves while
                        juggling WFH and their household chores.
                        Alex Katz (1927), an American painter, is widely known for his portraits, large paintings, and
                        sculptures. With bold use of bright colours and figurative paintings, these works marked a
                        seminal role in the transition from Abstract Expressionism to Pop Art. But he never considered
                        himself to fit in these art movements. He believes in the "immediate present" - he wanted to
                        paint people and his surroundings (flowers, crops and such) in the state they are at that very
                        minute. This brought about the New Realism. While Katz painted portraits of friends and
                        passersby, his muse was his wife - Ada Del Moro Katz.
                        It is absolutely fascinating to observe his growth during his career spanning over seven
                        decades. What drew me to his artworks is the fact that they seemed so light, yet compelling. The
                        loud brush strokes and solid colors are other aspects I found intriguing.
