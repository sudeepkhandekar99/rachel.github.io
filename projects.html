    <h2 class="sub-headings">The Spread Sunshine Project</h2>
    <p>The first thing that people tell me when I ask them to draw, is that they can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo art.‚Äù That was the first
      thought that spearheaded this project. The Spread Sunshine Project is a collaborative art project which included a
      mail exchange and doodle compilation. The main motive behind this project was to enable and encourage people to
      share doodles and/or messages to one another to help us through these stressful times.

    <h2 class="sub-headings">The Daily Moments</h2>
    <p>It was around the peak of COVID and lockdown anxieties when this project randomly came into form on a Sunday
      evening. My friend shared an Instagram post which led me to ask people to share their happy moments. I chose to
      design the compilation as a newspaper to give everyone a relaxing read to complement their evening tea.
