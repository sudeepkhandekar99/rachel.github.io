    <h2 class="sub-headings">The Spread Sunshine Project</h2>
    <p>The first thing that people tell me when I ask them to draw, is that they can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo art.‚Äù That was the first
      thought that spearheaded this project. The Spread Sunshine Project is a collaborative art project which included a
      mail exchange and doodle compilation. The main motive behind this project was to enable and encourage people to
      share doodles and/or messages to one another to help us through these stressful times.
    </p>
    <p style="color: maroon;">I do not own the copyright in any of the artworks/doodles compiled in this project.
      Contributors retain their
      rights in their work. Compiled on Canva.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-headings">The Daily Moments</h2>
    <p>It was around the peak of COVID and lockdown anxieties when this project randomly came into form on a Sunday
      evening. My friend shared an Instagram post which led me to ask people to share their happy moments. I chose to
      design the compilation as a newspaper to give everyone a relaxing read to complement their evening tea.

    <p>Parichay by Keya Sampat aims at helping an individual realise their true potential. Keya offers various
      psychological services and also conducts sessions for schools and organisations. In 2020, she curated a Mental
      Health Care Box with an intention to celebrate one‚Äôs strengths. It is available on a subscription basis and has
      different themes. I had a chance to design affirmation cards for the Mental Health Care Box based on the themes
      decided by Keya. It was a unique experience and I‚Äôm grateful to Parichay for this opportunity. Find more details
